# StackGP
Stack based genetic programming system in Python


The StackGP.py file contains the Python function library for StackGP. It also contains the functions used for active learning. 

Demo.ipynp contains a simple demo that uses the system to train models on a sample problem.

StackGPVis.ipynb contains some plotting features in development.
